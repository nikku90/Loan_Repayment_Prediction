# Loan_Repayment_Prediction
We will use some very important Algorithm like Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier to build a classification model to predict whether a customer will repay the loan or not

In this Notebook we will use Tree base Algorithm to Build a classification model to predict whether a customer will repay the loan or not. We will start with Decision Tree model which use the if-else type of statement to classify the data. Than we will use the Random forest Classifer a bagging algorithm that create multiple decision tree parallely by randomly sampling the columns and rows of data.

We will additionaly see the Hyperparameter tuning for both the algorithms.
